# Notes For Educators

## Teaching Notes
* Our workshop had about 20 participants and 2 instructors. Larger groups should have more assistants.
* Our participants ranged in age from Minecraft coding kids to adult teachers to professional web devs!
* Ask your participants their backgrounds and interest. If people in your audience have knowledge to share, empower them to teach each other or to add additional information that the instructors might not have.
* This workshop was funded and supported by [Side Street Projects](sidestreet.org). They paid for all parts for participants, which motivated attendance!

## Technical Notes
* Because we have so many participants we did not use Bluetooth keyboards. We purchased a variety of powered USB hubs. Not all of them work.
* These [Amazon Basics](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Port-2-5A-power-adapter/dp/B00DQFGH80/) hubs work great but are pricey.
* These [Vemont powered hubs](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-Aluminum-Windows-Android-VM-309P-US/dp/B01NA8UBO7) worked great too.
* It's important that you use 2Amp power supplies for your Chip with this setup. The 1A iphone-style power supply would start up the computer but then they'd die or have brownouts when launching the browser or using a VGA adaptor.
* We had power issues with the NextThingCo's HDMI adaptor that we weren't able to totally solve, so in general we preferred using VGA adaptors or composite. Maybe we needed to eliminate the wired keyboard and upped our power to 2.5A? I'm not an expert on power. Let us know if you find a good combo that works.
* The composite cables from NextThingCo have color guides on them that don't match up with the standards on your monitor or TV. So if you plug it in and the color onscreen is gray try unplugging and switching up your connections.

## Further Plans
* We anticipate holding future workshops in building [ChiPirateBox](www.raspibo.org/wiki/index.php/ChiPirate-BOX:_the_chipest_and_cheapest_Pirate-BOX_ever). Our participants were very interested in secure and anonymous messaging and information/document/file-trading.
